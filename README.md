# News-Recommendation
This project builds a personalized news recommendation system using the Microsoft MIND dataset.
It compares multiple approaches including popularity baselines, TF‑IDF, Word2Vec, SVD, and deep neural sequence models (RNN, LSTM).
The pipeline includes full data preprocessing, impression parsing, temporal splitting, and class‑imbalance handling.
Models are evaluated using AUC, MAP, and NDCG to measure ranking quality and personalization effectiveness.
The final results highlight the strengths of content‑based and sequence‑aware models for dynamic news recommendation.
